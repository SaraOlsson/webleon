           <h3 class="font-alt mt-40 mb-0">Introduction</h3>
           <hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">
           <p>

             The thought of procedural generation has fascinated me since I first heard about it. I mean..
             imagine walking through a virtual environment you set up yourself, and bump into creatures and scenery
             you did not explicitly created or placed there. To generate the meshes would be one step, and representing
             their surfaces another. This project focuses on the latter. In particular, methods for having the surface
             varying based on the surroundings are discussed. Further, as an UV-map would not be available for procedural
             generated meshes, one interesting aspect is to, despite that, achieve a varying surface based on area on the mesh.
             While a non-procedural mesh is used for testing, it can be applied for a procedural created mesh as well and I look forward to do so.

            To really point out the benefits of using a procedural shader, I chose to imitate the skin of a chameleon. This animal has the interesting
            capability of camouflaging according to its surrounding or mood, depending on species. Further, it has detailed cell pattern in its skin
            which opens up for the possibility to play around with different noise functions.

          </p>


          <h5 class="font-alt">Aim</h5>
          <p>

            The purpose of this project is to achieve a procedural texture which colors depend on the surrounding. A control panel should be be
            available to the end user, for creative adjustments regarding parameters such as cell size, color variations and amount of procedural bump mapping.

         </p>
         <p> To be used: Unity + HLSL shader code. </p>

         <h5 class="font-alt">Limitations</h5>
         <p>

           This project covers an alternative for UV mapping. While an UV map can be generated
           automatically it often need manual justifications and will add a substantial complexity
           to this solution, it will not be discussed.

        </p>

         <h3 class="font-alt mt-40 mb-0">Theory</h3>
         <hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">

         <h5 class="font-alt">Characteristics of chameleons</h5>
         <p>

           First, because animals are cool, let us quickly cover some main characteristics of the chameleon skin which are to be imitated.
           In fact, the most outer skin is transparent and underneath are small “crystals” which colors are controlled by the chameleons
           hormones. However a virtual version works just fine with setting the final color directly, no layers needed. Like in real life,
           the transition is smooth and has a duration of about a second or two and this is a behaviour to keep.

        </p>

        <h5 class="font-alt">UV-maps</h5>
        <p>

          A UV map can be interpreted as the 3D model stretched out into a flat 2D image,
          a procedure often referred as UV-unwrap. Each face in the polygon then has a
          corresponding face on the UV map and thus it's possible to attach attributes
          for different parts of the mesh easily. A common use of the UV map is to place 2D textures
          according to the flattened faces, while another is to mark areas with values
          representing other characteristics. As for example, these characteristics could
          correspond to the length, thickness or bend direction of fur.  Also, a few integer
          values can be used to label areas as “leg”, “tshirt”, or “hair”, to then attach
          separate surface attributes in the shader based on the label. Especially this last
          example would be useful in the creation of a procedural texture. when the object
          has distinct variations in different areas.



       </p>
       <h5 class="font-alt">Noise </h5>
       <p>

         Gradient noise is a technique used to produce natural structures in computer
         graphics, in particular to obey for the irregularity in the majority of all natural objects
         - things are simply not flat and exact. Grass grows in tufts, dust covers surfaces and
         kitchen clinker has details of imperfections. The list of examples can continue infinitely.
         A fragment shader processes each fragment individually and with the same code, yet the
         desired output should be continuous and coherent in its entirety. Gradient noise has proven
         its ability to meet these needs.
         The first known implementation of a gradient noise function is Perlin noise, which since
         then has increased the appearance of realism in computer graphics. Along with the
         classic Perlin noise, further developments has led to similar implementations as Simplex noise,
         Worley noise (Cellular Noise), and Voronoi noise. Common for all these implementations is
         the necessity that the positions used in the fragment shader are transformed to local coordinate
         space, as the chameleon is suppose to move.

       </p>
       <b>

        Classic Perlin noise

      </b>
      <p>

        The main idea of Perlin noise is to first generate regularly spaced points in space,
        each with function value zero and with a pseudo-random gradient assigned. Then, a
        continuous function is retrieved with an interpolation between the points given the
        gradients. Similarly for noise in higher dimensions, the points are regularly spaced
        in each direction for the  dimension in question and interpolation is computed between
        the closest points. As the gradients are pseudo-random, the same result will be achieved
        every time the program runs with the same parameters which is often highly desired.

        2D noise versus 3D noise

      </b>
      <p>

        2D noise may seem convenient to use for a surface texture, as the common method to
        give a 3D object its appearance is to map a 2D texture to it. One advantage is that
        information retrieved by the noise function, as the vector to the closest point, will
        actually refer to a point on the surface. However, a UV-map would be needed to map the
        3D coordinates of the mesh to the corresponding texture pixel. Without the UV-map, there
        is no suited input to the 2D noise function.

        Noise in 3D comes with some pros and cons as well. Unlike the 2D version, there are no
        visible seams due to UV mapping which is good. One notable downside though is the that
        while the noise is a volume, the surface we see is actually just a cross section. That
        is, the points we would define as the center points in a cell pattern are (most usually)
        not actually the actual center points. While the surface is not explicitly defined,
        approximations can be obtained with the use of linear algebra.

      <h3 class="font-alt mt-40 mb-0">Method</h3>
      <hr class="divider-w mt-10 mb-20">

      <p>
        The project includes creating a procedural cell pattern,
        using bump mapping for the illusion of three-dimensional cells,
        and generating colors to camouflage the object to its surroundings.
      </p>


      <h5 class="font-alt">Procedural pattern</h5>
      <p>

        The main cell pattern is created with Voronoi noise. Fine details are
        achieved with a combination of the main cell pattern and another pattern
        created with the very same method except for a smaller value on the scale parameter.
        Adjustable parameters was introduced for cell size ( noise scale )
        and level of uniformness, i.e. scale of random displacement of the feature points.

        The shader has two different modes depending on whether the camouflage
        the effect is on or off. A set of colors is to be set by the user to
        reflect the default appearance of the chameleon. Below are these colors
        labeled, along with a description of how this value is overridden in camouflage mode. </br> </br>

        - base color, <i> overridden by the average value of the current render texture. </i></br>
        - main cell color, <i> overridden with values from the render texture - sampled with noise values. </i></br>
        - two normal dependent colors ( like top and bottom colors ), <i>overridden by.. </i></br>
        - color spots, <i>overridden by.. </i></br>

     <h5 class="font-alt">Procedural UV-map imitation</h5>
     <p>

      It is all about to take advantage of the little information available
      in the fragment shader and the limited input parameters.

    </p>

    <h5 class="font-alt">Procedurell Bump Mapping</h5>
    <p>

      To create the illusion of three-dimensional cells in the skin,
      procedural bump mapping is used. As the Voronoi noise function
      returns a vector to the nearest feature point, it can be used to
      modify the normal. When the light calculation is then performed for
      this normal, the illusion is created that the surface is directed in
      a different direction than is actually the case and shadows and
      highlights are created.

   <h5 class="font-alt">Camouflage effect</h5>
   <p>
     The targeted appearance had the following ambitions: </br>
    - the colors of the animal should not change with camera orbiting </br>
    - surrounding objects should not be obviously recognized in the skin like
     a mirror surface, rather their colors should be represented in a more abstract way.
   </p>

  <b>

    First approach:

  </b>
  <p>

    As a first approach, the reflection in the normal direction was used to reflect
    the colors of the surroundings in the chameleon's skin. The idea was that each
    cell would get the color sampled by the center point, i.e. the position used to
    retrieve the reflection color is the center point of the cell. During tests of
    this approach, the following difficulties were discovered: finding this exact
    point in the surface when the noise function is in 3D, and the fact that also
    the normal of the center point can not be reached from the fragment shader.
    However, after some consideration it also got clear and that the colors of the
    reflection would not actually represent the near environment very well, for example,
    the top of the animal would always get the color of the sky.

  </p>

  <b>

    Final approach:

  </b>
  <p>

    Later on the approach was instead to make use of a camera.
    The chameleon has a camera that follows its position, located above.
    This camera ignores the chameleon and renders everything else to a
    render texture. This texture is then used as input to the shader and
    can be sampled as a texture2d.

  </p>

  <h5 class="font-alt">Test environment</h5>
  <p>

    To test the camouflage effect, a scene was created in Unity with a number
    of colorful areas. The user can control the chameleon to move and then
    activate the camouflage at the desired location. 3D models for the chameleon
    and most other assets to create an interesting environment are obtained from
    the Unity Asset Store or other sources under creative commons.
